## Getting Started

This game utilizes array, API's, and objects. 
Used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of a topic. 

* Calling the GIPHY API
* Using JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.
GIPHY parameters used:
     * `q`
     * `limit`
     * `rating`

## Built With

* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* HTML5


## Running the tests

* Create an array of strings, each one related to a topic of interests(winter). Saving it to a variable called `topics`.
 

* takes the topics in this array and creates buttons in the HTML.
* Using a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.

* When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

* Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
   * This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
   * Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.

* Add a form to your page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your `topics` array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.
